# Create a Token

This Solidity contract implements a simple ERC20-like token with public details, balance tracking, and minting and burning functionalities.

## Description

The `MyToken` contract is a simple token implementation with public variables for the token's name ("META"), abbreviation ("META"), and total supply. It includes a mapping to track balances of different addresses. The `mint` function allows increasing the total supply and the balance of a specified address. The `burn` function decreases the total supply and the balance of a specified address, ensuring the address has enough tokens to burn. This contract provides basic token functionalities including minting and burning tokens while tracking total supply and individual balances.

The `MyToken` contract is a basic token implementation with public variables for the token name, abbreviation, and total supply. It includes a mapping to track individual balances. The contract features a `mint` function to increase the total supply and an address's balance, and a `burn` function to decrease the total supply and an address's balance, ensuring sufficient balance before burning.
